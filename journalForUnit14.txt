made moving obstacles

09/12/25:

I lost most of my progress due to cloud issues.

Re-wrote my project so that it now has:

a player that can move (animated) + health counter
basic hazards (obstacles)
Collectibles (and a score counter) 

16/12/25
added movingPlatform which i wrote in class
started debugging process on why a few sprites were not rendering properly
Finished level 1
implemented a "turret" (almost done, need to debug why it doesn't actually do damage)
